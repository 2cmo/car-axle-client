# Modules (It's a mess)

UIManager -> section -> Button -> Module

So yes, the button owns the Module
You may be used to a system like this:

UIManager -> section -> Button & Module

or

UIManager -> section -> Module -> Button

Why am I different? Idk, it just felt right. Just make sure to keep this detail in mind while editing
