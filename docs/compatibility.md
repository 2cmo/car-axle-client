## Why isn't there Firefox support?
Firefox doesn't support the bookmarklet maker I use, making it impossible to even start. Other generators don't format the large codebase correctly and end up just not working, rendering that solution useless. Could I make it work with these other generators? Yeah, but it'll take up time that could've been better spent else where. This is why there is no plans for future Firefox support.
